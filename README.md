# Joyful-Web Placeholder Site

This is a starter static website for your photography portfolio.
## How to use
1. Edit the HTML files to add your own copy and image URLs.
2. Replace placeholder Unsplash images with your compressed JPEG/WEBP photos.
3. Commit and push to GitHub. Enable **GitHub Pages** in repo settings (branch `/`).
4. Toggle **Enforce HTTPS** once the site is live.
5. Point your custom domain via A records if desired. See GitHub's docs for the current IP list.
