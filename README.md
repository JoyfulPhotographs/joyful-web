# Joyful-Web Placeholder Site

This is a starter static website for your photography portfolio.
## How to use
1. Create a `docs/images` directory and place your photos there, naming them `portrait.jpg`, `landscape.jpg`, `wildlife.jpg`, and `street.jpg` (or adjust filenames in `index.html` to match your file names).
2. Edit the HTML files to reference your local images (e.g. `<img src="images/portrait.jpg" alt="Portrait">`) instead of the Unsplash placeholders.
3. Commit and push to GitHub. Enable **GitHub Pages** in repo settings (branch `/`).
4. Toggle **Enforce HTTPS** once the site is live.
5. Point your custom domain via A records if desired. See GitHub's docs for the current IP list.
